# Python IA with TensorFlow
Simulation creation to implement low-traffic areas in Horta.

## Tecnologies
1. Pygame
2. Matplotlib
3. Tkinter

## Introduction
Vehicle congestion is a problem in many cities around the world, causing strong negative impacts in affected areas such as increased pollution levels or a waste of  time for those affected. 
Our work focuses on how smart traffic light systems are being implemented in large cities and what's their true impact.
In our case, we have already recreated a 2D MAP of a residential area of Barcelona, Horta (08031) with an implementation of autonomous cars; making a decision on each node, and implementing traffic lights to manipulate that traffic.
The variables to be used will be: 
1. The number of vehicles.
2. Zone's own transit network.
3. A random range passersby variable depending on the actual traffic of the street.
4. The actual change time of the traffic lights itself.
